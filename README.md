## How It Works

* At the start of each round, the Computer randomly chooses a letter. 
* The User tries to guess the Computer's letter by pressing on any letter key from 'a' to 'z.'
* The letters selected by the User shows up in 'Letters Guessed' for up to 7 times (the number of guesses the User has to select the Computer's letter).
* When the User correcly guesses the letter, the User wins by 1 point.
* When the User incorrectly guesses the letter, the 'Number of Guesses' decreases by 1. 
* When the User runs out of guesses, the User loses by 1 point.
* The game restarts once the User wins or loses.
