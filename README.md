## How-It-Works

* At the start of each round, the computer randomly chooses a letter. 

* The user tries to guess the computer's letter by pressing on any letter key from A to Z and the game begins.

* If the user does not guess correctly, the 'Number of Guesses' decreases by 1 and the letters the user guessed shows up in 'Letters Guessed' for up to 7 times.

* When the user correcly guesses the letter, the user wins by 1 point. 

* When the user runs out of guesses before correctly choosing the computer's letter, the user loses by 1 point.

* The game restarts once the user wins or loses.
