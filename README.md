#Psychic Game

To play Psychic Game, the user tries to guess the letter that the computer is "thinking" within 7 guesses.
The user wins by guessing the computer's letter within 7 guesses. 
If the user does not guess the computer's letter within 7 guesses, the user loses.

##How It Works

At the start of each round, the computer randomly chooses a letter. 
The user tries to guess the computer's letter by pressing on any letter key from A to Z and the game begins.
If the user does not guess correctly, the 'Number of Guesses' increases by 1 and the letters the user guessed shows up in 'Letters Guessed' for up to 7 times.
When the user correcly guesses the letter, the user wins by 1 point. 
When the user runs out of guesses before correctly choosing the computer's letter, the user loses by 1 point. 
The game restarts once the user wins or loses.
